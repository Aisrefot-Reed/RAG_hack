Scopely announced today that Monopoly Go! has surpassed $5 billion in gross bookings, and that it has hit this target within 24 months — faster than any game in mobile gaming history. The company revealed the figure and thanked the players who have helped the title reach that goal, and gave a sneak preview of what’s coming in the near future.

Massimo Maietti, Scopely’s president of gaming, said in a blog post, “To provide context: over the past decade, more than 1.4 million mobile titles have launched globally. Among them, MONOPOLY GO! reached this financial milestone in just 24 months—significantly ahead of the previous benchmark of 40 months.”

Monopoly Go! recently celebrated its 2-year anniversary, during which time it’s hosted millions of players. The studio also noted that, in terms of numbers, players have made 500 million in-game connections and 450 million invites, and that 20 million players engage with the game’s community channels on a regular basis.

Maietti also gave a view on what’s coming next for Monopoly Go!, including that the studio plans to implement new board designs and enhanced PvP mechanics, alongside a roadmap of tournaments and themed events. It’s also planning to continue evolving the sticker system. Maietti said, “As we enter our third year, our mission is unchanged: to continue delivering a best-in-class, deeply socially connected, and creatively engaging experience for our players.”
