Bring It On, the maker of skill-based games, said its Big Cash Bingo game has become one of the fastest growing skill games on the market with more than $500,000 in monthly revenues.

The game also has more than 80,000 players worldwide spending 17 million minutes playing each month — and over $45 million has been won in-game to date.

Launched in 2023, Bring It On’s Big Cash Bingo revenue has grown 1,200%. Big Cash Bingo allows players to compete against each other and win real cash prizes. The game introduces multiple sector-first features including a progression metagame, daub tools, and innovative, new standard-setting game types. New games are released every day with different challenges, events, and game modes. Players can earn thousands in cash prizes from their smartphone from anywhere in the world.

Building on the success of Big Cash Bingo, Bring It On is also announcing plans for the soft-launch of its next real-money skill game: Big Cash Legends. Set to debut in May for a limited audience ahead of a full launch in summer 2025, Legends introduces a new generation of skill-based games designed for broader appeal. The game offers a wider variety of formats, more flexible ways to play, and new mechanics that reward both quick play sessions and long-term progression.

With Legends, Bring It On aims to evolve the real-money skill gaming space by combining accessible gameplay with deeper systems that encourage mastery over time. Players will be able to explore multiple game types, develop strategies, and compete in challenges tailored to different play styles and skill levels – all while earning real cash prizes.

Big Cash Bingo is a skill gaming hit.

Bring It On’s founders – Leonard Frankel, Alex Adonin and Matan Liberman – started the company in 2022 and they bring decades of mobile games experience having previously held senior positions at Plarium (acquired by Aristocrat for $500 million), Jelly Button (acquired by Playtika), Diwip and Globo, where they helped scale games to millions of players. Bring It On raised $7 million to date.

CEO Leonard Frankel is a former professional poker player turned serial entrepreneur, and has pioneered a culture that attracts top talent across the globe with a flat hierarchy and ability to work remotely from anywhere.

“The traction we have seen since launch is fantastic, but what really excites our team is the feedback we get from players – and the fact our players keep playing. In fact our retention level far exceeds the skill games average,” said Frankel, in a statement. “The challenge we enjoy on a daily basis is to keep our players engaged with new challenges and other players to compete with.”

“We’re constantly listening to our players and taking on their feedback, and this is helping us when we are developing Big Cash Legends. We can’t wait for skill game players to experience what we have been working on for many months,” added Frankel.

The company operates fully remotely in order to attract global talent. Its current team counts 24 people, each with an average experience of a decade in their own field, many of whom have worked on games reaching massive scale and success.

I asked Frankel why he wanted to do skill games. In a message to GamesBeat, Frankel said, “Early on, I was a professional poker player. That experience was empowering — I controlled my destiny, made my own decisions, and the better I got, the more I earned, without a boss telling me what to do. I wanted to recreate that sense of empowerment for others, but in a more accessible, casual gaming environment.

Skill games perfectly blend competition and self-improvement, letting players directly benefit financially from their skill.”

He added, “My partners and I bring extensive experience from creating casual games enjoyed by hundreds of millions worldwide. Drawing on this background, we knew we could craft innovative, memorable experiences that resonate deeply with our players, far beyond traditional skill-based gaming.”

And I asked how the company stands out from competitors like Skills. Frankel said, “We go deeper on player engagement with our games. We focus on creating meaningful, long-term journeys for players by delivering rich, engaging entertainment. Our games offer rewarding experiences beyond just the competitive aspect, ensuring players enjoy ongoing personal progression, exploration, and social interaction, which keeps them coming back.”

He said games like Big Cash Bingo have features like a progression metagame, special daub tools, and innovative new game types, making the experience much richer and more meaningful.

The company has 24 people, fully remote across Israel and Europe.

Big Cash Bingo has a small but dedicated audience.

“We hire very experienced individuals – each averaging about 10 years in the gaming industry – and maintain a culture where everyone is a decision-maker. Our team members’ intense engagement and ownership is a major reason behind Bring It On’s rapid progress,” Frankel said.

The company has raised $7 million to date. As far as the take rate goes, Frankel said it varies.

“Generally, we keep about 20% from the total wagered amounts, depending on the game mode and the prize structure,” he said. “That portion goes to fund the variety of promotional activity we offer in our games, where players can earn additional money by renovating beautiful locations around the world, by participating in events and completing missions. We try to give back as much as possible to our players, to complement their journey with us.”

The company’s number of players is small but the revenues are high.

Bring It On’s flagship game is Big Cash Bingo.

“That was precisely our strategy initially. We focused first on highly engaged users to build a solid, profitable base,” Frankel said. “Now we’re scaling towards broader appeal with Big Cash Legends, our upcoming title. Legends will offer a wide variety of games, specifically designed to cater to a broader audience. We aim to create magical experiences for everyone – imagine all the super popular mobile games you’ve enjoyed; we strive to capture those fun experiences and present them in an exciting, competitive format.”
