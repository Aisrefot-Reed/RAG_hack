“Everyone is in a war trying to get the majority of these people,” Bogliari says.

Assuming a deal goes through, TikTok’s dominance is likely still safe. The app is uniquely appealing for its recommendation algorithms, for the features it offers creators to help them make videos and collaborate with others, and for its ability to launch nearly anyone into at least temporary viral fame—something that is harder to achieve on other social media platforms. But that could change as its future hangs in the balance.

There are four apps that seem to be the main potential threats to TikTok’s dominance, each with different audiences, features, and challenges. Here’s a rundown of each.

Byte

What it is: Byte launched earlier this year as resurrection of Vine, the short-form 6-second video platform that was shut down by its corporate owner, Twitter, in 2016 (Vine is the inspiration for every other video app out there right now, including TikTok.) Byte's creator Dom Hofmann, who was also one of the founders of Vine, teased Byte as a sequel to the beloved app during its development.

What it's like: If TikTok absorbed the internet’s latent Vine energy to fuel its culture, without necessarily elevating or crediting the Vine creators responsible for it, then Byte became the place where some of those creators and fans actually ended up. @SymphonicRon, a 29-year-old musician who grew a modest following on Vine is now on Byte, in part, because it provided an opportunity to earn some income off of his work through its audio licensing program, he said in an interview (he doesn’t use his full name online, and asked to go by his handle for privacy reasons for this article.) He heard about it from fellow former Viners.

But Byte was a pretty quiet place, @SymphonicRon said, before TikTok came under scrutiny of the US government. “There weren't that many people there. The most popular posts were getting 300 likes,” he said. Now, things are getting a lot more interaction, as TikTok users flood in, and the actual content that does well on the platform has “"definitely changed" in just a few days.

Who it's for: Bogliari described Byte as the least threatening to TikTok’s dominance of the contenders out there, but that might be because of the same things that make Byte fun to be on. There’s a lot of art and music, and a lot of humor subgenres that are kind of similar to Alt TikTok. It’s niche, and maybe that’s the point.

Reels

What it is: Facebook, which owns Instagram, has a history of copying the features of other successful social media platforms and absorbing them into its own products. Reels is the latest attempt to do that, working within Instagram, and allowing users to create 15-second, looped videos. There’s a tab in explore that leads to a feed of Reels content, much like TikTok’s “For You” page.
