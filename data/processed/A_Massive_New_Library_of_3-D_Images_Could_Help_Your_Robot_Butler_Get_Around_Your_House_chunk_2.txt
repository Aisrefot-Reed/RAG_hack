ill apply deep learning—the same machine-learning technique used on ImageNet—to train computers to better understand 3-D scenes (see “10 Breakthrough Technologies 2013: Deep Learning”). He created the data set with Angela Dai, one of his students at Stanford, and Thomas Funkhouser, a professor at Princeton, as well as several of his other students. The researchers describe their approach in a paper posted recently online. They built the data set by scanning 1,513 scenes using a 3-D camera simila
