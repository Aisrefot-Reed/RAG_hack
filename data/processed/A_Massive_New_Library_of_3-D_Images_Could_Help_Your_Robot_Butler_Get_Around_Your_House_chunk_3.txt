by scanning 1,513 scenes using a 3-D camera similar to the Microsoft Kinect. This device uses both a conventional camera and an infrared depth sensor to create a 3-D picture of the scene in front of it. The researchers then had volunteers annotate the scans using an iPad app via Amazonâ€™s Mechanical Turk crowdsourcing platform. To improve overall accuracy, one set of participants painted and labeled the objects in a scan, and another group was asked to re-create a scene using a 3-D model. Stefani
