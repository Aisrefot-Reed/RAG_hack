As a result, while the per-token cost for Claude 3.5 Sonnet’s input may be lower, the increased tokenization can offset these savings, leading to higher overall costs in practical use cases. This hidden cost stems from the way Anthropic’s tokenizer encodes information, often using more tokens to represent the same content. The token count inflation has a significant impact on costs and context window utilization. Domain-dependent tokenization inefficiency Different types of domain content are to
