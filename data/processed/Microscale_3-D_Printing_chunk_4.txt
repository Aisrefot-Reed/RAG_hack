ke inks out of various types of cells and the materials that form the matrix supporting them. The work addresses one of the lingering challenges in creating artificial organs for drug testing or, someday, for use as replacement parts: how to create a vascular system to keep the cells alive. Top: Inks made of silver nanoparticles are used to print electrodes as small as a few micrometers. Bottom: As in the other 3-D printing processes, the operation is controlled and monitored by computers. Left:
