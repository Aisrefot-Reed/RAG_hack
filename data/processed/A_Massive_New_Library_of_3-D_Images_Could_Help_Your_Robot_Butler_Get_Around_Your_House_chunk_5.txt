 room showing annotated items in different colors. Niessner says the team behind the data set tried applying deep learning and found that it could recognize many objects reliably using only their depth information, or their shape. This already suggests that the 3-D data will provide a deeper understanding of the physical world, he says. He adds that using 3-D information is a better way of mimicking the way animals perceive things. Siddhartha Srinivasa, a professor at the Robotics Institute at C
