native to the existing solution: damming one of North America’s mightiest rivers and pumping its water hundreds of miles. When he started at Arizona State University as an undergraduate, he gravitated to materials science, which he calls a “trifecta of physics, chemistry, and mechanical engineering.” His doctoral research at MIT focused on the properties of thin metallic films and the quantum mechanics of catalysis related to fuel cells. Upon earning his PhD in 2004, he returned to ASU, joining
