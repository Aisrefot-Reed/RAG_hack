team power is already proving to be an effective tool in Earth orbit. DSI had previously applied a technique known as water-based electrothermal propulsion (essentially steam power) to develop the Comet, a device that could maneuver satellites in orbit. Bradford Space, which purchased DSI, continues to sell it. On the recent ride-sharing SSO-A SmallSat Express launch last year, four of the satellites that hitched a ride were equipped with the water-propelled Comet. DSIâ€™s former competitor Planet
