es the manual labor of labeling data. The fact that iGPT uses the same algorithm as GPT-2 also shows its promising adaptability. This is in line with OpenAIâ€™s ultimate ambition to achieve more generalizable machine intelligence. At the same time, the method presents a concerning new way to create deepfake images. Generative adversarial networks, the most common category of algorithms used to create deepfakes in the past, must be trained on highly curated data. If you want to get a GAN to generat
