” says Alison Dufresne, a space propulsion and systems engineer at Bradford Space. “Steam engines have been around for a long time. We know how they work.” In theory, as long as WINE has access to solar or nuclear power and water, it will be able to explore indefinitely. However, the steam thrust gives the craft only enough power to move in very low-gravity situations, meaning it won’t be rocketing from Jupiter to Mars anytime soon. The craft’s mining and propulsion system was successfully teste
