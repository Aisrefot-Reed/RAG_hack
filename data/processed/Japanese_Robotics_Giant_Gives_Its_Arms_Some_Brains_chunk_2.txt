 Fanuc will use Nvidia processors inside individual robots and also in a central system that controls all the bots in a factory. The training will feed into the central system, which Nvidia calls a “GPU supercomputer,” and trained models will then be transferred to robots to execute actions, using computer vision and deep learning. “Complex robots with high levels of articulation can perform a task in many ways, so they generate a lot of data and require massive amounts of computing power,” says
