y targeted during training. Data engineering leads may also consider the model’s reasoning format—designed to reflect intermediate problem-solving steps—as a mechanism for tracking logical consistency across long sequences of structured data. The structured output format could be integrated into validation layers or logging systems to support explainability in data-rich applications. From a governance and safety standpoint, Phi-4-reasoning-plus incorporates multiple layers of post-training safet
