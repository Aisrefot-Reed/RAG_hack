To master tool use, the robot also observes human behavior. Combining its lessons from the two types of learning then lets the robot determine how to use an object in a new situation. Annie Xie, an undergraduate student at UC Berkeley involved with the project, writes about the work in a related blog post: â€œWith a mix of demonstration data and uns
