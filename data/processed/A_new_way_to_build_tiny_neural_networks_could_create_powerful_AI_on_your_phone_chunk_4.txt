twork is initialized before the training process, there’s always some likelihood that the randomly assigned connection strengths end up in an untrainable configuration. In other words, no matter how many animal photos you feed the neural network, it won’t achieve a decent performance, and you just have to reinitialize it to a new configuration. The larger the network (the more layers and nodes it has), the less likely that is. Whereas a tiny neural network may be trainable in only one of every f
