g about how to hack together new solutions,” he says. The zinc-air battery had its genesis when Friesen looked at the periodic table and asked what the cheapest possible battery would be. That led him to think about oxygen in the air as the cathode and zinc metal as the anode. Zinc-air batteries had been around for about 100 years, but nobody knew how to recharge them. They discharge the energy stored in the zinc by exposing it to the air’s oxygen, creating zinc oxide and releasing electrons. Bu
