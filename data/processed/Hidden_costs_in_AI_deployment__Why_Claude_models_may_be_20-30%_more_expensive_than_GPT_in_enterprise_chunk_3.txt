ncy” Despite lower input token rates of the Anthropic model, we observed that the total costs of running experiments (on a given set of fixed prompts) with GPT-4o is much cheaper when compared to Claude Sonnet-3.5. Why? The Anthropic tokenizer tends to break down the same input into more tokens compared to OpenAI’s tokenizer. This means that, for identical prompts, Anthropic models produce considerably more tokens than their OpenAI counterparts. As a result, while the per-token cost for Claude 3
