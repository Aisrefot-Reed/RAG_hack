 a self-driving car to learn and adapt its behavior within each interaction, not just between them. Another challenge, Sadigh says, is that the approach assumes knowledge of the best way to describe a collaborator’s behavior. The researchers themselves had to come up with the labels “right,” “left,” and “center” in the air hockey game for the robot to describe its opponent’s actions.
