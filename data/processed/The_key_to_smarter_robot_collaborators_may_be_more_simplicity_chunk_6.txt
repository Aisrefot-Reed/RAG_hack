or example, that every interaction the robot engages in is finite, says Jakob Foerster, an assistant professor at the University of Toronto, who was not involved in the work. In the self-driving simulation, the researchers assumed that the robot car was experiencing only one clearly bounded interaction with another car during each round of training. But driving, of course, doesnâ€™t work that way. Interactions are often continuous and would require a self-driving car to learn and adapt its behavio
