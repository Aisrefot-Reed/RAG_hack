 tension between accurate prediction and effective exploration in recommendation systems, he says. Despite past studies showing that users will tolerate lower levels of accuracy to gain the benefit of diverse recommendations, developers still have a disincentive to design their algorithms that way. “It is always easier to ‘be right’ by recommending safe choices,” Konstan says. Konstan also critiques the DeepMind study for approaching filter bubbles and echo chambers as machine-learning simulatio
