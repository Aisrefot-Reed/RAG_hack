Title: A robot hand taught itself to solve a Rubikâ€™s Cube after creating its own training regime URL: https://www.technologyreview.com/2019/10/15/75292/a-robot-hand-taught-itself-to-solve-a-rubiks-cube-after-creating-its-own-training-regime/ In the latest paper, OpenAI takes this technique one step further. Previously, the researchers had to randomize the parameters in the environment by hand-picking which permutations they thought would lead to a better algorithm. Now the training system does t
