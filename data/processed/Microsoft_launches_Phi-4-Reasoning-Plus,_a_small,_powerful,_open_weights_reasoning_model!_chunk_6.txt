omoting both transparency and coherence in long-form problem solving. Reinforcement learning for accuracy and depth Following fine-tuning, Microsoft used outcome-based reinforcement learning—specifically, the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm—to improve the model’s output accuracy and efficiency. The RL reward function was crafted to balance correctness with conciseness, penalize repetition, and enforce formatting consistency. This led to longer but more thoughtful responses, p
