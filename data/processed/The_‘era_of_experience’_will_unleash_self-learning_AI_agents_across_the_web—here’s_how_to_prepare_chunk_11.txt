Today, agents that can interact with complex environments (e.g., AI computer use) and advances in reinforcement learning will overcome these limitations, bringing about the transition to the era of experience. What does it mean for the enterprise? Buried in Sutton and Silver’s paper is an observation that will have important implications for real-world applications: “The agent may use ‘human-friendly’ actions and observations such as user interfaces, that n
