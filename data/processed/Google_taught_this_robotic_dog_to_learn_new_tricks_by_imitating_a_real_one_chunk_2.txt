were able to port the final control algorithm into a physical robot in the lab—though some moves, like the running man, weren’t entirely successful. Why it matters: Teaching robots the complex and agile movements necessary to navigate the real world has been a long-standing challenge in the field. Imitation learning of this kind instead allows such machines to easily borrow the agility of animals and even humans. Future work: Jason Peng, the lead author on the paper, says there are still a numbe
