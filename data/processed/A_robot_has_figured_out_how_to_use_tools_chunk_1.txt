 off-the-shelf robot arm that can be controlled by a person or a computer. It also includes a camera that sees the environment within reach of the armâ€”and, most important, a computer running a very large neural network that lets the robot learn. The robot worked out how to make use of simple implements, including a dustpan and broom and a duster, to move other objects around. The work hints at how robots might someday learn to perform sophisticated manipulations, and solve abstract problems, for
