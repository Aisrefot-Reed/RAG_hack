kens—about 8.3 billion of them unique—drawn from synthetic and curated web-based datasets. A reinforcement learning (RL) phase, using only about 6,400 math-focused problems, further refined the model’s reasoning capabilities. The model has been released under a permissive MIT license — enabling its use for broad commercial and enterprise applications, and fine-tuning or distillation, without restriction — and is compatible with widely used inference frameworks including Hugging Face Transformers
