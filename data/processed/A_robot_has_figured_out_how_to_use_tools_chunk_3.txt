The new robot learns in a similar way, but it builds a more complex model of the physical world (“Moving this item can move those other items over there”). The robotic system learns in several ways. To get a basic understanding of cause and effect, it experiments with objects on its own, nudging them around to see the results. It is also fed data from lots of previous robot learning. Throughout, a recurrent
