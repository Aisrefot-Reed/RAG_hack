he midwater collector’s headache. “DeepPIV was developed to look at fluid physics,” she explains. In the early 2010s, Katija and her team were studying how sea sponges filter-feed and wanted a way to track the movement of water by recording the three-dimensional positions of minute particles suspended in it. They later realized the system could also be used to noninvasively scan gelatinous animals. Using a powerful laser mounted on a remotely operated vehicle, DeepPIV illuminates one cross-secti
