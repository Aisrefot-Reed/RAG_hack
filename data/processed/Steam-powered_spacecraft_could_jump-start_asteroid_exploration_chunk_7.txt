ining and propulsion system was successfully tested here on Earth last month. The tests showed that WINE can create enough force to hop between asteroids using water mined from model asteroid material. However, it’s still a long way off from an initial launch, although the team is looking for partners to make that happen. “We’ve been using steam for centuries,” says Zacny. “Without it we wouldn’t be here right now. So steam could be this first step to exploring space.”
