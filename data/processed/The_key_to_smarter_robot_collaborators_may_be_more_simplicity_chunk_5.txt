 The researchers tested this idea in simulation for applications including a self-driving car, and in the real world with a game of robot air hockey. In each of the trials, the new technique outperformed previous methods for teaching robots to adapt to surrounding agents. The robot also effectively learned to influence those around it. Future work There are still some issues that future research will have to resolve. The work currently assumes, for example, that every interaction the robot engag
