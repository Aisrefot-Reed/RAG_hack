, for example, the iCAC algorithm is validated pre-deployment by running the model on a balanced set of CT scans while radiologists manually score â€” then the two are compared. In post-deployment review, meanwhile, radiologists are given a random subset of AI-scored CT scans and perform a full iCAC measurement that is blinded to the AI score. McCaffrey explained that this allows his team to calculate model error recurrently and also detect potential bias (which would be seen as a shift in the mag
