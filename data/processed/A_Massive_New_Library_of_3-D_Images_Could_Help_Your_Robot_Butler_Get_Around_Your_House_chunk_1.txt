e hope is that ScanNet will give machines a deeper understanding of the physical world, and that this could have practical applications. “The obvious scenario is a robot in your home,” Niessner says. “If you have a robot, it needs to figure out what’s going on around it.” An off-the-shelf 3-D scanner was used to capture each room. Niessner, who did the work while he was a visiting associate professor at Stanford University, believes researchers will apply deep learning—the same machine-learning
