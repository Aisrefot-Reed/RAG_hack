aks, made by a skilled video editor, can make them seem even more real. Video trickery involves using a machine-learning technique known as generative modeling, which lets a computer learn from real data before producing fake examples that are statistically similar. A recent twist on this involves having two neural networks, known as generative adversarial networks, work together to produce ever more convincing fakes (see “The GANfather: The man who’s given machines the gift of imagination”).
