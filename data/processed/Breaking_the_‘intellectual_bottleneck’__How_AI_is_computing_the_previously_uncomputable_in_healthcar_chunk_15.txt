oint space narrowing (common in arthritis). McCaffrey and his team have found that successive model versions both within classes (various versions of GPT-4o) and across classes (GPT-4.5 vs 3.5) tend to have lower hallucination rate. “But this is non-zero and non-deterministic so — while nice — we can’t just ignore the possibility and ramifications of hallucination,” he said. Therefore, they typically gravitate to generative AI tools that do a good job of citing their sources. For instance, a mod
