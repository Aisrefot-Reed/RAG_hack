 water using solar or nuclear power over the course of about 10 days, building up pressure inside. Then, in a burst, the pressure is released as steam, firing the spacecraft to its next nearby destination. The concept is reminiscent of the ones proposed by asteroid-mining companies Deep Space Industries (DSI) and Planetary Resources. Grant Bonin, former chief engineer of DSI, once called its prototype Prospector-1 craft “a flying steam kettle.” Steam power is already proving to be an effective t
