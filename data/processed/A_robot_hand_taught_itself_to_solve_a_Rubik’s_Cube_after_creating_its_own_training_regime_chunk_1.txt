a better algorithm. Now the training system does this by itself. Each time the robot reaches a certain level of mastery in the existing environment, the simulator tweaks its own parameters to make the training conditions even harder. The result is an even more robust algorithm that can move at the precision required to rotate a Rubik’s cube in real life. Through testing, the researchers found that Dactyl also successfully solved the cube under various conditions that it hadn’t been trained on. F
