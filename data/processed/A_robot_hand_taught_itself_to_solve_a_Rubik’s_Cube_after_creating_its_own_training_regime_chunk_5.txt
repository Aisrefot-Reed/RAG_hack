 robots,” he says. “I see this as a very specific system meant for a specific application.” Part of the problem, Berenson believes, is reinforcement learning itself. By nature, the technique is designed to master one particular thing, with some flexibility for handling variations. But in the real world, the number of potential variations extends beyond what can reasonably be simulated. In a cleaning task, for example, you could have different kinds of mops, different kinds of spills, and differe
