s and sensors that measure linear and angular motion. Another sits on top of a carâ€™s roof and consists of two machine-vision cameras, motion sensors, and a simple lidar. Drivers use that device to map dense city streets, because lidar is good at capturing the geometry of three-dimensional structures. The company claims its approach captures details that are accurate within five centimeters , which is on par with other technologies. To map an area, drivers simply follow turn-by-turn audio directi
