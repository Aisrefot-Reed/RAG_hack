ematical equations, the overhead stands at 21%, and for Python code, Claude generates 30% more tokens. This variation arises because some content types, such as technical documents and code, often contain patterns and symbols that Anthropicâ€™s tokenizer fragments into smaller pieces, leading to a higher token count. In contrast, more natural language content tends to exhibit a lower token overhead. Other practical implications of tokenizer inefficiency Beyond the direct implication on costs, ther
