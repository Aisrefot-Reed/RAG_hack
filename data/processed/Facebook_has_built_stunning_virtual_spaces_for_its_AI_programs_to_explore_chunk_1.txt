 other simulation engines run at around 50 to 100 frames per second, Facebook says AI Habitat runs at over 10,000 frames per second, which makes it possible to test AI agents rapidly. Home alone: These virtual spaces can be loaded into a new environment called AI Habitat, inside which AI programs can explore and learn. The algorithms will first be trained to recognize objects in different settings. But over time they should build some common-sense understanding about the conventions of the physi
