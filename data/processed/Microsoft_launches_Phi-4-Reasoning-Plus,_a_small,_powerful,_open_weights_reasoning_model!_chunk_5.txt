s, Microsoft employed a data-centric training strategy. During the supervised fine-tuning stage, the model was trained using a curated blend of synthetic chain-of-thought reasoning traces and filtered high-quality prompts. A key innovation in the training approach was the use of structured reasoning outputs marked with special <think> and </think> tokens. These guide the model to separate its intermediate reasoning steps from the final answer, promoting both transparency and coherence in long-fo
