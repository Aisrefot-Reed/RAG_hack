 not. In some ways it feels like they’re trying to counter the threat from Valve’s Steam Deck. They don’t want to just offer a less powerful Steam Deck. Some of their design may have been reactive to that. I don’t know if that’s a good thing. It doesn’t seem like a big target to go after. Hawkins: I agree. I think it’s probably more to do with the fact that if the Switch doesn’t evolve fast enough, it starts to look pretty dodgy compared to whatever the latest consoles and high-end PC game rigs
