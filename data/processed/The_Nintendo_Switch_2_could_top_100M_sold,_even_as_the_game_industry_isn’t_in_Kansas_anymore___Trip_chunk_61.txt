ilm, but it’s also really funny. There’s really good humor around some deep, serious issues that these people are having. That’s one of the things I like about the work of David O. Russell, the director. He manages to pull that off a lot. Anyway, I’m figuring that my character in the film–the guy playing me is a comedian, right? It’s easy to predict that he’s going to be the court jester in this storyline and provide some comic relief. There are some interesting trends happening in the industry.
