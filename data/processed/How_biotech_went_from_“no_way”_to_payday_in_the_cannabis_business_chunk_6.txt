A dozen synthetic-biology companies, including Amyris, Ginkgo Bioworks, Hyasynth, Farmako, and Intrexon, say they are moving the cannabis genes into bacteria, oozing algae, or fermenting vats of yeast. This year, biologists at the University of California, Berkeley, inserted the critical steps in the cannabinoid recipe into yeast cells and reported the results in the journal Nature.
