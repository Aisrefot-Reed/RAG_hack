Title: Japanese Robotics Giant Gives Its Arms Some Brains URL: https://www.technologyreview.com/2016/10/07/70007/japanese-robotics-giant-gives-its-arms-some-brains/ Machine learning offers a way to have a robot reprogram itself by learning how to do something through practice. The technique involved, called reinforcement learning, uses a large or deep neural network that controls a robotic armâ€™s movement and varies its behavior, reinforcing actions that lead it closer to an end goal, like pickin
