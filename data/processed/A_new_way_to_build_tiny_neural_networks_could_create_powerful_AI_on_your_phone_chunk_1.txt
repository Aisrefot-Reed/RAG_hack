 unlock new applications—some of which we can’t yet fathom—that could improve our day-to-day lives. More on that later. But first, let’s dive into how neural networks work to understand why this is possible. A diagram of a neural network learning to recognize a lion. JEFF CLUNE/SCREENSHOT How neural networks work You may have seen neural networks depicted in diagrams like the one above: they’re composed of stacked layers of simple computational nodes that are connected in order to compute patter
